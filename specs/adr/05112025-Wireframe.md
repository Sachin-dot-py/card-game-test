# Wireframe decisions as of 5/11/2025

## Discussing the General Layout of the Website

- We wanted to make a clear layout about what features we wanted to add to the overall design of the campus event website. This included a variety of things such as what we wanted the user to

## Considered Options

- Making it similar to Tinder where you can swipe right or left depending on what events the user would enjoy or not. Ideally this would be the homepage so that the user can immediately start looking at events, just like how Tiktok immediately starts showing you videos when you open the app.
- Adding a calendar API so that the user could very clearly see when specific events would take place
- Implementing a single event page, where a UCSD student can learn more about a singular event, such as the location, time, etc
- Creating a "browse event" page where the user can see all events on campus based on different topics and categories such as events happening now, popular events, etc (imagine something similar to the Netflix homepage)

## Decision Outcome

- We will implement almost everything mentioned in considered options except the calendar API due to time constraints and overall difficulty. If time permits, we will come back to this later and implement it
- The browse events pages will be the stretch goal for the project since it would ultimately be the heart of the website

#### Positives of choice

- Makes it more realistic for us as developers to accomplish the stretch goal before the due date, given our lack of experience
- Puts all UCSD campus events in one place, making it easy for the user to interact with different events and browse them

#### Negatives of choice

- Implementing the calender API would've been better for the user since it would've used a way of organizing dates and events everyone is familiar with. Leaving this out could let the user miss out on very useful features.
