# Backend Storage Decisions

## Context and Problem Statement

- We need to decide how we are going to be storing our events. This is 2-folded. Firstly, we need the global events which are all the events in on our website. Next is the user's liked events or disliked events.

## Considered Options

- localStorage
- indexdb
- JSON file
- external Database (like Firebase)

## Decision Outcome

For now, we have decided to stick with having our global events in a JSON file and will come back and change it later on to an actual database if needed. We mainly want to get a functioning prototype out quick and databases are complicated. We will store user related events in the browsers localStorage. The events will be in an array of stringified JSON objects.

#### Positives of choice

- Fast and easy to implement (similar to Lab 6)
- No need to learn anything new and no APIs involved

#### Negatives of choice

- localStorage only has 5MB of space
- using a JSON that we update each time isn't good when you start thinking of multiple users
